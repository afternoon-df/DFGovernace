# Korea Deepfake Law Summary

## Core Legal Framework
- `Framework Act on the Development of AI and Creation of a Foundation for Trust`: transparency duties for high-impact/generative AI and compliance architecture (`Article 31-36`). (Ref1, Ref2)
- `Public Official Election Management Rules (Annex 1-3)`: concrete deepfake label items/methods for election-context media operations. (Ref4)
- `Act on Fair Labeling and Advertising`: unfair labeling/advertising prohibition, corrective powers, and sanction channels. (Ref5, Ref6, Ref7)
- `Information and Communications Network Act`: platform/network-side provisions for synthesized-video harm-prevention policy, rights protection, deletion/temporary blocking, self-regulation, unlawful information, damages, and penalty/administrative-fine channels. (Ref9, Ref10, Ref11, Ref12)
- `School Violence Prevention Act`: youth/school-context law that expressly includes AI-edited/synthesized/processed sexual deepfake-type materials within the definition of cyber violence. (Ref13)

## Summary
- Korea uses a layered model rather than a single deepfake statute: the Framework Act sets horizontal AI obligations, while election, advertising, and enforcement pathways are operationalized through existing sectoral legal instruments. (Ref1, Ref2, Ref4, Ref5)
- Policy strength should therefore be read by context of use (election, general service, commercial communication), not by counting provisions in one law. (Ref2, Ref4, Ref6)
- The newly added Information and Communications Network Act materials strengthen the Korea profile on network circulation and platform response: they define synthesized-video harm as an online-distribution policy issue and connect rights infringement to deletion, temporary blocking, self-regulation, damages, and sanctions. (Ref9, Ref10, Ref11, Ref12)
- The newly added School Violence Prevention Act material adds a distinct school/youth pathway: deepfake sexual materials can be treated as cyber violence in school settings, linking synthetic abuse to victim protection, reporting, and school-response machinery. (Ref13)

## Policy Dimensions
- `Labeling status`: Korea’s labeling regime is dual-track. `Framework Act Article 31/32` sets baseline duties (advance notice and generated-output indication) for high-impact/generative AI services, while election context adds more operationally specific media-format requirements under `Annex 1-3`. In practice, this functions as “statutory baseline + context-specific format rules.” (Ref1, Ref4)
- `Election-related status`: election governance is one of Korea’s most operationalized deepfake areas. Annex 1-3 provides implementable label items/display methods that can be translated directly into workflow checks for publication and circulation stages. The key caveat is that annex rules should be interpreted together with the broader election-law framework. (Ref4)
- `Non-consensual deepfake status`: non-consensual deepfake harms are addressed through existing criminal/special-law enforcement channels rather than a stand-alone AI-framework offense chapter. The Information and Communications Network Act gives a direct online-distribution anchor for AI-edited/synthesized/processed face, body, or voice material made against the subject's will, while the School Violence Prevention Act expressly captures sexual deepfake-type materials as cyber violence in student/school contexts. Application remains category-specific and cross-statute. (Ref9, Ref13)
- `Service-provider/platform liability status`: provider liability is structurally split across three channels: high-impact AI governance duties under the Framework Act, consumer-protection enforcement under fair-labeling law, and network/platform response under the Information and Communications Network Act. The network-law track supports rights-protection duties, deletion/temporary blocking after requests, self-regulatory guidelines for unlawful information, and large-provider reporting/response architecture. (Ref2, Ref6, Ref10, Ref11)
- `Penalty/sanctions codification status`: sanctions follow a mixed pathway. Framework Act `Article 42/43` provides penalty/administrative-fine triggers, Fair Labeling Act `Article 7/18` supports corrective and punitive enforcement, and the Information and Communications Network Act adds penalties for non-compliance with regulator orders, unlawful-information distribution, joint penalty provisions, confiscation/collection, and administrative fines. Practical risk management should track first violation, takedown/temporary-blocking response, regulator order, and post-order non-compliance. (Ref3, Ref6, Ref7, Ref12)

## Practice Notes (by Dimension)
- `Labeling`: include fixed release checks for advance notice text, generated-output marking method, and display placement; retain evidence logs (UI captures/version records) for audits.
- `Election`: run Annex 1-3 checks as a separate election-content gate rather than inside generic moderation flow to reduce omission risk during election periods.
- `Non-consensual deepfakes`: define pre-approved incident SOPs that combine evidence preservation, rapid circulation blocking, and law-enforcement/reporting handoff.
- `School/youth context`: treat student-targeted synthetic sexual material as a separate high-risk pathway, because the school-violence framework creates reporting, protection, and response expectations beyond generic platform moderation.
- `Service-provider/platform liability`: separate technical-risk controls (Framework Act side), consumer-protection controls (fair-labeling side), and network-response controls (deletion/temporary blocking/self-regulation side), but merge all into one incident-tracking record.
- `Penalty`: maintain an escalation matrix covering first violation, deletion/temporary-blocking handling, regulator orders, post-order non-compliance, repeat scenarios, and administrative fines so legal/policy/ops teams use the same trigger logic.

## Verify Before Use
- Any sentence relying on Ref8 should be manually verified at sentence level before formal publication.
- Ref13 is based on a `.doc` official text whose extraction is noisy; the cited provisions are visible in the embedded text but should be checked in a cleaner official format if one is later added.
